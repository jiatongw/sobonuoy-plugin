### A very simple plugin used in Sonobuoy

* This is a runable sample plugin. Please first clone it, then type ```make``` to build and push the docker image. Or you can just pull from my dokcerhub [clike here](https://cloud.docker.com/u/jiatongw/repository/docker/jiatongw/sample)

* Please have your K8s cluster ready and make sure ```sonobuoy``` commands work.

* Make sure you have a ```sonobuoy.yaml```

#### Run sample plugin

```kubectl apply -f /path/to/sonobuoy.yaml ```
